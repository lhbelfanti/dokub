# Frontend project

This project uses a Docker, Travis CI and AWS, to build the project, run the tests and deploy a new version of it when a change is made over the master branch.

It uses the [Dockerfile.dev](./Dockerfile.dev) to run the tests and the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) is used by the AWS bucket to show the app.
The [.travis.yml](./.travis.yml) file is in charge of the deployment to AWS.

## AWS

It uses Elastic Beanstalk, and the application is deployed in a S3.

Due possible billings, the application on Elastic Beanstalk was deleted. 

> **_NOTE:_** If the bucket is created again in the future, you should follow the [AWS Configuration Cheat Sheet](#aws-configuration-cheat-sheet) and the .travis.yml file located in the 04-frontend folder, should be moved to the root of this repository.


## AWS Configuration Cheat Sheet

### Initial Setup

1. Go to AWS Management Console

### Deploying App

1. Make any change to a file in the project, commit and push it to master branch.
2. Go to your Travis Dashboard and check the status of your build.
3. The status should eventually return with a green checkmark and show "build passing"
4. Go to your AWS Elasticbeanstalk application
5. It should say "Elastic Beanstalk is updating your environment"
6. It should eventually show a green checkmark under "Health". You will now be able to access your application at the external URL provided under the environment name.
